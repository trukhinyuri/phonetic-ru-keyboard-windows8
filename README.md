###Current status
Fab 01, 2025: Added durty workaround for Windows ARM64 (ONLY FOR ARM64, tested on Surface 11 Pro with Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite).
For adding keyboard, use
./WindowsARM64Workaround/build/Release/kli.exe

To my great regret, Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 does not support ARM64, and Windows requires that the layout be installed via a binary file (utter madness!). Microsoft, please fix thisâ€”at the very least, add ARM64 support to MKLC, and even better, simply allow keyboard layouts to be described in text form, as is done in Linux.
